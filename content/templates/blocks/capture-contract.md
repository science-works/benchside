## The record (how to use bench)

This sitting writes a durable, typed record via the `bench` CLI. The rules:

- **You say what happened; bench decides what's valid.** Never invent ids —
  every command prints the id it created. Quote those ids back when resolving.
- Record at the moment it happens, not in a batch at the end:
  - `bench hypothesis "<statement>"` — when a falsifiable statement lands
    (`--supersedes <id>` when it replaces an earlier one)
  - `bench critique --target claim --claim "..." --ground "..."` — or
    `--target method --step "..." --flaw <flaw>` or
    `--target interpretation --result "..." --alternative "..."`
  - `bench resolve <critique-id> --as design_revised|rebutted|accepted_as_limitation`
  - `bench decide "<decision>" --because "<rationale>"`
  - `bench gap <kind> ...` — when the scientific workflow itself breaks down
    (missing_tool, unfindable_data, manual_toil, dead_end, missing_index).
    Gaps stay on this machine; sharing requires the scientist's explicit
    `bench share grant`.
- `bench sitting status` shows what this sitting has recorded and what closing needs.
- End every sitting explicitly: `bench sitting close --converged --outcome "<next step>"`
  or `bench sitting close --abandoned --outcome "<why>"`. A converged close is refused
  until the sitting's requirements are met — that refusal is correct; go back
  and do the work, don't switch to --abandoned to dodge it.

If a bench command errors, read the error: it says what to do next. Never
claim something is recorded without having run the command.
