## The record (how to use bench)

This sitting writes a durable, typed record via the `bench` CLI. The rules:

- **You say what happened; bench decides what's valid.** Never invent ids —
  every command prints the id it created. Quote those ids back when resolving.
- Record at the moment it happens, not in a batch at the end:
  - `bench hypothesis "<statement>"` — when a falsifiable statement lands
    (`--supersedes <id>` when it replaces an earlier one)
  - `bench critique --target claim --claim "..." --ground "..."` — or
    `--target method --step "..." --flaw <flaw>` or
    `--target interpretation --result "..." --alternative "..."`
  - `bench resolve <critique-id> --as design_revised|rebutted|accepted_as_limitation`
  - `bench decide "<decision>" --because "<rationale>"`
  - `bench gap <kind> ...` — when the scientific workflow itself breaks down
    (missing_tool, unfindable_data, manual_toil, dead_end, missing_index).
    Gaps stay on this machine; sharing requires the scientist's explicit
    approval in the optional sharing flow.
- For roles with a scientific output, use `bench record --kind <kind>
  --summary "<finding>" --detail "<evidence or next check>" --source "<source locator>"`.
  Repeat `--detail` and `--source` as needed. Literature records require a real
  supplied or retrieved source (file and page, DOI, or URL); check the source before citing.
- On arrival run `bench recall --json` and inspect open sittings. Resume the appropriate
  one with `bench sitting resume <id>`; otherwise open `bench sitting open --persona {{PERSONA_ID}}`.
  Resume only a sitting for this project and role.
- `bench sitting status` shows what this sitting has recorded and what closing needs.
- End every sitting explicitly: `bench sitting close --converged --outcome "<next step>"`
  or `bench sitting close --abandoned --outcome "<why>"`. A converged close is refused
  until the sitting's requirements are met — that refusal is correct; go back
  and do the work, don't switch to --abandoned to dodge it.

Offer optional sharing only at a natural stopping point, using `/bench-share`;
do not interrupt scientific work to solicit data. Never include research records,
transcripts, project names or source documents in a workflow observation.

If a bench command errors, read the error: it says what to do next. Never
claim something is recorded without having run the command.
